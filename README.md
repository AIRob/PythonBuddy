### Usage
1) Fetch from repo:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/ethanchewy/PythonBuddy.git
  ```
2) Change to directory
  ```
  cd PythonBuddy
  ```
2) Create virtualenv based on your own system:
  ```
  python3 -m venv venv
  ```
3) Activate vitrual environment:
  ```
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
4) Pipe requirements to venv folder:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
5) Set FLASK_APP variable:
  ```
  export FLASK_APP=app.py
  ```
6) Run flask app:
  ```
  flask run
  ```
  Open your browser to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) . Voila! üéâ

### Customization Options

1. Edit app.py to change any pylint options (like showing/hiding hints warnings)
2. Security
 1. To create a much more secure Python Environment, consider using RestrictedPython: https://github.com/ethanchewy/OnlinePythonLinterSyntaxChecker/tree/restrictedpython
 2. For more security but enough flexibility, you could restrict the temp.py python file without read/write permissions via these instuctions: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/186202/what-is-the-best-way-to-open-a-file-for-exclusive-access-in-python
3. For versions that used Python 2 or to see older versions, check: https://github.com/ethanchewy/PythonBuddy/releases

### Unit Tests

### Future Goals:
- Make easily embeddable for MOOCs like edX and other education platform
- Create an analytics system that models the student's python learning and tells them where they need improvement (many programming students learn by copying and pasting and don't actually understand the nuances of the Python language).
- Stricter Python Sandboxing via Pypy's sandboxing solution
- Lower CPU usage
- Allow users to generate a link to a unique code snippet similar to JSBin
- Unit tests for client side JS

### FAQ:
Why did you make this? <br>
I made this so that MOOCs like edX or codecademy could easily embed and use this on their courses so students wouldn't have to go through the frustrations of setting up a Python environment and jump right into Python programming with the support of live syntax checking & highlighting.(Programming MOOCs often have a high attrition rate due to the difficulties of setting up an environment). Also, professors and teachers could easily set up a server and allow students to quickly test out their code with PythonBuddy online.

Has anyone created anything like this before? <br>
There has never been a live syntax checker for python online. Similar projects that are not "live" are http://pep8online.com/ and http://antares.sip.ucm.es/cesar/pylint/

Has can I contribute? <br>
You can üåü star my repo, fork my repo, submit a pull request, and/or open issues!

Where's the code for embedding it in MOOCs? <br>
I'm currently working on this over here (for edx specifically): https://github.com/ethanchewy/pybuddy2.0 . If you want to embed this project directly to your site, you would use an iframe:
```
<iframe src="https://pythonbuddy.com"></iframe>
```

I want the code to actually compile and run in a certain way?<br>
If you want to actually execute the python safely look at my Restricted Python branch: https://github.com/ethanchewy/PythonBuddy/tree/restrictedpython. If you want to run the code more quickly, check out the testing branch which uses Python 3 but may have some bugs: https://github.com/ethanchewy/PythonBuddy/tree/testing.

How do I run my own server?
